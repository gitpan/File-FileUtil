1.0 SCOPE
    This paragraph identifies and provides an overview of the released
    files.

  1.1 Indentification

    This release is a collection of Perl modules that extend the
    capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview

    The system is the Perl programming language software. The system does
    not have any hardware. The Perl programming language contains two
    features that are utilized by this release:

    1   Program Modules to extend the languages

    2   Plain Old Documentation (POD) that may be embedded in the language

    These features are established by the referenced documents.

    This release adds low level utilites used initially in support of the
    functional Test::STDmaker and ExtUtils::SVDmaker For these functional
    modules, File::FileUtils is a design module. However, the methods of
    File::FileUtils are of a general nature and may have uses in other
    modules. Thus, in order to provide possible reuse in other modules, the
    File::FileUtils module is broken out also as a functional module.

    The dependency of the functional program modules Test::STDmaker and
    ExtUtils::SVDmaker in the US DOD STD2167A bundle is as follows:

         Test::Tech File::FileUtil Test::STD::TestUtil
            DataPort::DataFile DataPort::FileType::FormDB
                Test::STDmaker ExtUtils::SVDmaker

    Test software should be short and not depend on any other modules. In
    other words, it should use just the basic core pure Perl and as little
    of the extension modules as possible. As such these utilities are a
    collection of very short methods, using core pure Perl and very few
    program modules (SelfLoader and use File::Spec) of seemingly
    functionally unrelated methods.

    Some of the capabilities they provide are as follows:

    *   Methods to change file specifications from one operating system to
        another.

    *   Methods that address the issue of different new line sequences for
        different operating systems

    *   Picking up data from program modules

    *   Loading program modules using an *eval* and testing that the program
        module vocabulary is present.

  1.3 Document overview.

    This document releases File::FileUtil version 0.01 providing a
    description of the inventory, installation instructions and other
    information necessary to utilize and track this release.

  3.3 Changes

    The changes from the previous version are as follows:

    *   At 02:44 AM 6/14/2003 +0200, Max Maischein wrote: A second thing
        that I would like you to reconsider is the naming of
        "Test::TestUtil" respectively "Test::Tech" - neither of those is
        descriptive of what the routines actually do or what the module
        implements. I would recommend renaming them to something closer to
        your other modules, maybe "Test::SVDMaker::Util" and
        "Test::SVDMaker::Tech", as some routines do not seem to be specific
        to the Test::-suite but rather general (format_array_table). Some
        parts (the "scrub" routines) might even better live in another
        module namespace, "Test::Util::ScrubData" or something like that.

        Broke away all the file related methods from Test::TestUtil and
        created this module File::FileUtil so the module name is more
        descriptive of the methods within the module.

    *   Broke the smart nl code out of the fin method and made it is own
        separate method, smart_nl method.

        At 02:44 AM 6/14/2003 +0200, Max Maischein wrote: Perl, as Perl
        already does smart newline handling, (even though with the advent of
        5.8 even Unix-people have to learn the word "binmode" now :-))

        The only place where I see Perl does smart newline handling is the
        crlf IO displine introduce in Perl 5.6. The File::FileUtil has a use
        5.001 so that 5.6 Perl built-ins cannot be used. Added comment to
        smart_nl that for users with 5.6 Perl that it may be better to use
        the built-in crlf IO discipline.

    *   For the load_package method that uses a eval "require $package" to
        load the package, the $@ does not capture all the warnings and error
        messages, at least not with ActiveState Perl. Added code the
        captures also the warnings, by temporaily reassigning
        $SIG(__WARN__), and added these to the $@ error messages.

    *   Added two new tests to verify the NOGO paths for the for the
        load_package method. One tests for load module failure looking for
        all the possilbe information on why the module did not load. The
        other verifies that the vocabulary is present after the loading the
        module. This information is very helpful when you must remote debug
        a load failure from CPAN testing whose is running on a different
        platform.

  3.4 Adaptation data.

    This installation requires that the installation site has the Perl
    programming language installed. Installation sites running Microsoft
    Operating systems require the installation of Unix utilities. An
    excellent, highly recommended Unix utilities for Microsoft operating
    systems is unxutils by Karl M. Syring. A copy is available at the
    following web sites:

     http://unxutils.sourceforge.net
     http://packages.SoftwareDiamnds.com

    There are no other additional requirements or tailoring needed of
    configurations files, adaptation data or other software needed for this
    installation particular to any installation site.

  3.5 Related documents.

    There are no related documents needed for the installation and test of
    this release.

  3.6 Installation instructions.

    To installed the release file, use the CPAN module in the Perl release
    or the INSTALL.PL script at the following web site:

     http://packages.SoftwareDiamonds.com

    Follow the instructions for the the chosen installation software.

    The distribution file is at the following respositories:

       http://www.softwarediamonds/packages/File-FileUtil-0.01
       http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/id/S/SO/SOFTDIA/File-FileUtil-0.01

  3.6.1 Installation support.

    If there are installation problems or questions with the installation
    contact

     603 882-0846 E<lt>support@SoftwareDiamonds.comE<gt>

  3.6.2 Installation Tests.

    Most Perl installation software will run the following test script(s) as
    part of the installation:

     t/File/FileUtil/FileUtil.t

  3.7 Possible problems and known errors

    The *pm2datah* and *pm2data* methods determines the data section by
    searching for the expression /^[\012\015]__DATA__/. If somehow this
    sequence appears in the code, it will cause a failure of these methods.
    Thus, when using this function, statments such as the below (if it is
    even a valid statement) cannot be used:

     $var = '
     __DATA__
     ';

    The File::FileUtil program module is the foundation program module for
    testing the 2167A automation modules and must be rock solid to ensure
    the quality of the Units that it will be testing. Testing of this module
    should be proactive and not dumped upon the end-user.

    There is still much work needed to ensure the quality of this module as
    follows:

    *   State the functional requirements for each method including not only
        the GO paths but also what to expect for the NOGO paths

    *   All the tests are GO path tests. Should add NOGO tests.

    *   Add the requirements addressed as *# R: * comment to the tests

    *   Write a program to build a matrix to trace test step to the
        requirements and vice versa by parsing the *# R: * comments.
        Automatically insert the matrix in the Test::TestUtil POD.

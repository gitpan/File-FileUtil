1.0 SCOPE
    This paragraph identifies and provides an overview of the released
    files.

  1.1 Indentification

    This release is a collection of Perl modules that extend the
    capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview

    The system is the Perl programming language software. The system does
    not have any hardware. The Perl programming language contains two
    features that are utilized by this release:

    1   Program Modules to extend the languages

    2   Plain Old Documentation (POD) that may be embedded in the language

    These features are established by the referenced documents.

    The system is the Perl programming language software. As established by
    the Perl referenced documents, program modules, such the
    "File::FileUtil" module, extend the Perl language.

    This release adds low level utilites used initially in support of the
    functional Test::STDmaker and ExtUtils::SVDmaker For these functional
    modules, File::FileUtils is a design module. However, the methods of
    File::FileUtils are of a general nature and may have uses in other
    modules. Thus, in order to provide possible reuse in other modules, the
    File::FileUtils module is broken out also as a functional module.

    The dependency of the program modules in the US DOD STD2167A bundle is
    as follows:

     File::FileUtil 
       Test::STD::Scrub
         Test::Tech
            DataPort::FileType::FormDB DataPort::DataFile Test::STD::STDutil
                Test::STDmaker ExtUtils::SVDmaker

    Test software should be short and not depend on any other modules. In
    other words, it should use just the basic core pure Perl and as little
    of the extension modules as possible. As such these utilities are a
    collection of very short methods, using core pure Perl and very few
    program modules (SelfLoader and use File::Spec) of seemingly
    functionally unrelated methods.

    Some of the capabilities they provide are as follows:

    *   Methods to change file specifications from one operating system to
        another.

    *   Methods that address the issue of different new line sequences for
        different operating systems

    *   Picking up data from program modules

    *   Loading program modules using an *eval* and testing that the program
        module vocabulary is present.

    Note the File::FileUtil, Test::STD::STDutil Test::STD::Scrub program
    modules breaks up the Test::TestUtil program module and Test::TestUtil
    has disappeared.

  1.3 Document overview.

    This document releases File::FileUtil version 0.03 providing a
    description of the inventory, installation instructions and other
    information necessary to utilize and track this release.

  3.3 Changes

    THe following changes were made:

    test_lib2inc
        Returns to parent directory of the first t directory going up from
        the test script instead of the t directory.

    find_t_roots
        Added the function find_t_roots that returns the parent directory of
        all the directories in @INC

    Changes to past revisions are as follows:

    Test::TestUtil 0.01
        Originated

    Test::TestUtil 0.02
        Correct failure from Josts Smokehouse"
        <Jost.Krieger+smokeback@ruhr-uni-bochum.de> test run

        t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil....Bareword "fspec_dirs" not allowed while
        "strict subs" in use at

          /net/sunu991/disc1/.cpanplus/5.8.0/build/Test-TestUtil-0.01/blib/lib/Test/TestUtil.pm line 56.

        Changed line 56 from

         my @dirs = (fspec_dirs) ? $from_package->splitdir( $fspec_dirs ) : ();

        to

         my @dirs = ($fspec_dirs) ? $from_package->splitdir( $fspec_dirs ) : ();

        This error is troublesome since the test passed on my system using
        Active Perl under Microsoft NT. It should never have passed. This
        error is in a core method, *fspec2fspec*, that changes file
        specifications from one operating system to another operating
        system. This method has been in service unchanged for some time.

    Test::TestUtil 0.03
        Correct failure from Josts Smokehouse"
        <Jost.Krieger+smokeback@ruhr-uni-bochum.de> test run

        PERL_DL_NONLAZY=1 /usr/local/perl/bin/perl "-MExtUtils::Command::MM"
        "-e" "test_harness(0, 'blib/lib', 'blib/arch')"
        t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil....# Test 18
        got: '$VAR1 = ''; ' (t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t at line 540 fail
        #17) # Expected: '$VAR1 = '\\=head1 Title Page

        The *pm2datah* method is not returning any data for Test 18. This
        will also cause the test of *pm2data*, test 19 to fail. The
        *pm2datah* is searching for the string "\n__DATA__\n".

        The "\n" character on Perl is a logical end of line character
        sequence. The "\n" end of line is different on Mr. Smokehouse's Unix
        operating system than on my Windows NT operating system. The test
        file was created under MSWin32 and uses a MSWin32 "\n". Under UNIX,
        *pm2datah* method will look for the Unix "\n" and there will not be
        any.

        Changed "\n__DATA__\n" to /[\012\015]__DATA__/.

        During the clean-up for CPAN, broke the *format_hash_table* method
        for tables in hash of hash format. Fixed the break, added test 29 to
        the *t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t* test script for this feature, and
        added a discusssion of this feature in POD discription for
        *format_hash_table*

    Test::TestUtil 0.04
        item our old friend visits again - DOS and UNIX text file
        incompatibility

        This impacts other modules. We have to examine all modules for this
        portability defect and correct any found defects.

        Correct failure from Josts Smokehouse"
        <Jost.Krieger+smokeback@ruhr-uni-bochum.de> and Kingpin
        <mthurn@carbon> test runs.

        On Mr. Smokehouse's run email the got: VAR1 clearly showed extra
        white space line that is not present in the expected: VAR1. In Mr.
        Kingpin's run the got: VAR1 and expected: VAR1 look visually the
        same. However, the Unix found a difference(s) and failed the test.

        For Mr. Smokehouse's run:

        PERL_DL_NONLAZY=1 /usr/local/bin/perl "-MExtUtils::Command::MM" "-e"
        "test_harness(0, 'blib/lib', 'blib/arch')"

        What we have before, was a totally "failure to communicate." aka
        Cool Hand Luke. VAR1 was empty. Now VAR1 has something. It is not
        completely dead. One probable cause is the Unix operating system
        must be producing two Unix \012 new lines for a Microsoft single
        newline \015\012. Without being able to examine the test with a
        debugger, the only way to verify this is to provide the fix and see
        if the problem goes away when this great group of testers try for
        the fourth time.

        Revised *fin* method to take a handle, change *pm2datah* method
        handle, *$fh*, to binary by adding a *binmode $fh* statement, and
        pass the actual thru the *fin* method for test 18.

        Use *fin($fh)* to read in the data for *pm2data*, test 19 Unit Under
        Test (UUT), instead of using the raw file handle.

        The *fin* method takes any \015\012 combination and changes it into
        the logical Perl new line, *"\n"*, for the current operating system.

            that I would like you to reconsider is the naming of
            "Test::TestUtil" respectively "Test::Tech" - neither of those is
            descriptive of what the routines actually do or what the module
            implements. I would recommend renaming them to something closer
            to your other modules, maybe "Test::SVDMaker::Util" and
            "Test::SVDMaker::Tech", as some routines do not seem to be
            specific to the Test::-suite but rather general
            (format_array_table). Some parts (the "scrub" routines) might
            even better live in another module namespace,
            "Test::Util::ScrubData" or something like that.

            Broke away all the file related methods from Test::TestUtil and
            created this module File::FileUtil so the module name is more
            descriptive of the methods within the module.

        *   Broke the smart nl code out of the fin method and made it is own
            separate method, smart_nl method.

            At 02:44 AM 6/14/2003 +0200, Max Maischein wrote: Perl, as Perl
            already does smart newline handling, (even though with the
            advent of 5.8 even Unix-people have to learn the word "binmode"
            now :-))

            The only place where I see Perl does smart newline handling is
            the crlf IO displine introduce in Perl 5.6. The File::FileUtil
            has a use 5.001 so that 5.6 Perl built-ins cannot be used. Added
            comment to smart_nl that for users with 5.6 Perl that it may be
            better to use the built-in crlf IO discipline.

        *   For the load_package method that uses a eval "require $package"
            to load the package, the $@ does not capture all the warnings
            and error messages, at least not with ActiveState Perl. Added
            code the captures also the warnings, by temporaily reassigning
            $SIG(__WARN__), and added these to the $@ error messages.

        *   Added two new tests to verify the NOGO paths for the for the
            load_package method. One tests for load module failure looking
            for all the possilbe information on why the module did not load.
            The other verifies that the vocabulary is present after the
            loading the module. This information is very helpful when you
            must remote debug a load failure from CPAN testing whose is
            running on a different platform.

    File::FileUtil 0.02
        Added the method *hex_dump*.

  3.4 Adaptation data.

    This installation requires that the installation site has the Perl
    programming language installed. Installation sites running Microsoft
    Operating systems require the installation of Unix utilities. An
    excellent, highly recommended Unix utilities for Microsoft operating
    systems is unxutils by Karl M. Syring. A copy is available at the
    following web sites:

     http://unxutils.sourceforge.net
     http://packages.SoftwareDiamnds.com

    There are no other additional requirements or tailoring needed of
    configurations files, adaptation data or other software needed for this
    installation particular to any installation site.

  3.5 Related documents.

    There are no related documents needed for the installation and test of
    this release.

  3.6 Installation instructions.

    To installed the release file, use the CPAN module in the Perl release
    or the INSTALL.PL script at the following web site:

     http://packages.SoftwareDiamonds.com

    Follow the instructions for the the chosen installation software.

    The distribution file is at the following respositories:

       http://www.softwarediamonds/packages/File-FileUtil-0.03
       http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/id/S/SO/SOFTDIA/File-FileUtil-0.03

  3.6.1 Installation support.

    If there are installation problems or questions with the installation
    contact

     603 882-0846 E<lt>support@SoftwareDiamonds.comE<gt>

  3.6.2 Installation Tests.

    Most Perl installation software will run the following test script(s) as
    part of the installation:

     t/File/FileUtil/FileUtil.t

  3.7 Possible problems and known errors

    The *pm2datah* and *pm2data* methods determines the data section by
    searching for the expression /^[\012\015]__DATA__/. If somehow this
    sequence appears in the code, it will cause a failure of these methods.
    Thus, when using this function, statments such as the below (if it is
    even a valid statement) cannot be used:

     $var = '
     __DATA__
     ';

    The File::FileUtil program module is the foundation program module for
    testing the 2167A automation modules and must be rock solid to ensure
    the quality of the Units that it will be testing. Testing of this module
    should be proactive and not dumped upon the end-user.

    There is still much work needed to ensure the quality of this module as
    follows:

    *   State the functional requirements for each method including not only
        the GO paths but also what to expect for the NOGO paths

    *   All the tests are GO path tests. Should add NOGO tests.

    *   Add the requirements addressed as *# R: * comment to the tests

    *   Write a program to build a matrix to trace test step to the
        requirements and vice versa by parsing the *# R: * comments.
        Automatically insert the matrix in the Test::STDutil POD.

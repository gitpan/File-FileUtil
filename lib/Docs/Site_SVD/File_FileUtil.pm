=head1 1.0 SCOPE

This paragraph identifies and provides an overview
of the released files.

=head2 1.1 Indentification

This release is a collection of Perl modules that
extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

=head2 1.2 System overview

The system is the Perl programming language software.
The system does not have any hardware.
The Perl programming language contains two features that
are utilized by this release:

=over 4

=item 1

Program Modules to extend the languages

=item 2

Plain Old Documentation (POD) that may be embedded in the language

=back

These features are established by the referenced documents.

The system is the Perl programming language software.
As established by the Perl referenced documents,
program modules, such the 
"L<File::FileUtil|File::FileUtil>" module, extend the Perl language.

This release adds low level utilites used initially in support of
the functional 
L<Test::STDmaker|Test::STDmaker> and
L<ExtUtils::SVDmaker|ExtUtils::SVDmaker>
For these functional modules, 
L<File::FileUtils|File::FileUtils> is a design module. 
However, the methods of L<File::FileUtils|File::FileUtils>
are of a general nature and may have uses in other modules.
Thus, in order to provide possible reuse in other modules,
the L<File::FileUtils|File::FileUtils> module is broken
out also as a functional module.

The dependency of the program modules in the US DOD STD2167A bundle is as follows:
 
 File::FileUtil 
   Test::STD::Scrub
     Test::Tech
        DataPort::FileType::FormDB DataPort::DataFile Test::STD::STDutil
            Test::STDmaker ExtUtils::SVDmaker

Test software should be short and not depend on any other
modules. In other words, it should use just the basic
core pure Perl and as little of the extension modules as possible.
As such these utilities are a collection of very short
methods, using core pure Perl and very few program modules
(SelfLoader and use File::Spec) 
of seemingly functionally unrelated methods.

Some of the capabilities they provide are as follows:

=over 4

=item *

Methods to change file specifications from
one operating system to another.

=item *

Methods that address the issue of different
new line sequences for different operating systems

=item *

Picking up data from program modules

=item *

Loading program modules using an I<eval> and testing
that the program module vocabulary is present.

=back

Note the 
L<File::FileUtil|File::FileUtil>, 
L<Test::STD::STDutil|Test::STD::STDutil> 
L<Test::STD::Scrub|Test::STD::Scrub> 
program modules breaks up 
the Test::TestUtil program module
and Test::TestUtil has disappeared.

=head2 3.3 Changes

THe following changes were made:

=over 4

=item test_lib2inc

Returns to parent directory of
the first t directory going up
from the test script instead of the
t directory.

=item find_t_roots

Added the function find_t_roots that
returns the parent directory of all
the directories in @INC

=back

Changes to past revisions are as follows: 

=over 4

=item Test::TestUtil 0.01

Originated

=item Test::TestUtil 0.02

Correct failure from Josts Smokehouse" <Jost.Krieger+smokeback@ruhr-uni-bochum.de>
test run

t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil....Bareword "fspec_dirs" not allowed 
while "strict subs" in use at 

  /net/sunu991/disc1/.cpanplus/5.8.0/build/Test-TestUtil-0.01/blib/lib/Test/TestUtil.pm line 56.

Changed line 56 from

 my @dirs = (fspec_dirs) ? $from_package->splitdir( $fspec_dirs ) : ();

to

 my @dirs = ($fspec_dirs) ? $from_package->splitdir( $fspec_dirs ) : ();

This error is troublesome since the test passed on my system using Active Perl
under Microsoft NT. It should never have passed. 
This error is in a core method, I<fspec2fspec>,
that changes file specifications from one operating system
to another operating system.
This method has been in service unchanged for some time.

=item Test::TestUtil 0.03

Correct failure from Josts Smokehouse" <Jost.Krieger+smokeback@ruhr-uni-bochum.de>
test run

PERL_DL_NONLAZY=1 /usr/local/perl/bin/perl "-MExtUtils::Command::MM" "-e" "test_harness(0, 'blib/lib', 'blib/arch')" t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t
t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil....# Test 18 got: '$VAR1 = '';
' (t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t at line 540 fail #17)
#    Expected: '$VAR1 = '\\=head1 Title Page

The I<pm2datah> method is not returning any data for Test 18. This will also cause
the test of I<pm2data>, test 19 to fail.
The I<pm2datah> is searching for the string "\n__DATA__\n".

The "\n" character on Perl is a logical end of line character sequence.
The "\n" end of line is different on Mr. Smokehouse's Unix operating system
than on my Windows NT operating system.
The test file was created under MSWin32 and uses a MSWin32 "\n".
Under UNIX, I<pm2datah> method will look for the Unix "\n"
and there will not be any.

Changed "\n__DATA__\n" to /[\012\015]__DATA__/. 

During the clean-up for CPAN, broke the I<format_hash_table>
method for tables in hash of hash format. 
Fixed the break, added test 29 to the I<t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t>
test script for this
feature, and added a discusssion of this feature in
POD discription for I<format_hash_table>

=item Test::TestUtil 0.04

item our old friend visits again - DOS and UNIX text file incompatibility

This impacts other modules. We have to examine all modules for
this portability defect and correct any found defects.

Correct failure from Josts Smokehouse" <Jost.Krieger+smokeback@ruhr-uni-bochum.de>
and Kingpin <mthurn@carbon> test runs.

On Mr. Smokehouse's run email the got: VAR1 clearly showed extra white space
line that is not present in the expected: VAR1. 
In Mr. Kingpin's run the got: VAR1 and expected: VAR1 look visually the same.
However, the Unix found a difference(s) and failed the test.

For Mr. Smokehouse's run:

PERL_DL_NONLAZY=1 /usr/local/bin/perl "-MExtUtils::Command::MM" "-e" "test_harness(0, 'blib/lib', 'blib/arch')" t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t
t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil....NOK 18# Test 18 got: '$VAR1 = '\\=head1 Title Page

 Software Version Description


 for


  File::FileUtil - Generic file utilites developed originally for Test::STDmaker and ExtUtils::SVDmaker

What we have before, was a totally "failure to communicate." aka Cool Hand Luke. 
VAR1 was empty. Now VAR1 has something. It is not completely dead.
One probable cause is the Unix operating system must be producing two Unix \012 new lines 
for a Microsoft single newline \015\012.
Without being able to examine the test with a debugger, the only way to verify
this is to provide the fix and see if the problem goes away when this great group
of testers try for the fourth time. 

Revised I<fin> method to take a handle, change I<pm2datah> method handle,  I<$fh>, 
to binary by adding a I<binmode $fh> statement, and pass the actual
thru the I<fin> method for test 18.

Use I<fin($fh)> to read in the data for I<pm2data>, test 19 Unit Under Test (UUT),
instead of using the raw file handle.

The I<fin> method takes any \015\012 combination and changes it into the 
logical Perl new line, I<"\n">, for the current operating system.

A second thing that I would like you to reconsider is the naming of
"Test::TestUtil" respectively "Test::Tech" - neither of those is descriptive
of what the routines actually do or what the module implements. I would
recommend renaming them to something closer to your other modules, maybe
"Test::SVDMaker::Util" and "Test::SVDMaker::Tech", as some routines do not
seem to be specific to the Test::-suite but rather general
(format_array_table). Some parts (the "scrub" routines) might even better
live in another module namespace, "Test::Util::ScrubData" or something like
that.

Broke away all the file related methods from Test::TestUtil and
created this module File::FileUtil so the module name is
more descriptive of the methods within the module.

=item *

Broke the smart nl code out of the fin method and made it
is own separate method, smart_nl method. 

At 02:44 AM 6/14/2003 +0200, Max Maischein wrote:
Perl, as Perl already does smart newline handling, (even though with the
advent of 5.8 even Unix-people have to learn the word "binmode" now :-)) 

The only place where I see Perl does smart newline handling is
the crlf IO displine introduce in Perl 5.6.  The File::FileUtil has
a use 5.001 so that 5.6 Perl built-ins cannot be used. Added comment
to smart_nl that for users with 5.6 Perl that it may be better to
use the built-in crlf IO discipline.

=item *

For the load_package method that uses a eval "require $package" to load the
package, the $@ does not capture all the warnings and error messages,
at least not with ActiveState Perl.  Added code the captures also the
warnings, by temporaily reassigning  $SIG(__WARN__), and added these
to the $@ error messages.

=item *

Added two new tests to verify the NOGO paths for the for the load_package
method.  One tests for load module failure looking for all the possilbe
information on why the module did not load. The other verifies that
the vocabulary is present after the loading the module.
This information is very helpful when you must remote debug a load
failure from CPAN testing whose is running on a different platform.

=head2 3.4 Adaptation data.

This installation requires that the installation site
has the Perl programming language installed.
Installation sites running Microsoft Operating systems require
the installation of Unix utilities. 
An excellent, highly recommended Unix utilities for Microsoft
operating systems is unxutils by Karl M. Syring.
A copy is available at the following web sites:

 http://unxutils.sourceforge.net
 http://packages.SoftwareDiamnds.com

There are no other additional requirements or tailoring needed of 
configurations files, adaptation data or other software needed for this
installation particular to any installation site.

=head2 3.5 Related documents.

There are no related documents needed for the installation and
test of this release.

=head2 3.6 Installation instructions.

To installed the release file, use the CPAN module in the Perl release
or the INSTALL.PL script at the following web site:

 http://packages.SoftwareDiamonds.com

Follow the instructions for the the chosen installation software.

The distribution file is at the following respositories:

   http://www.softwarediamonds/packages/File-FileUtil-0.03
   http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/id/S/SO/SOFTDIA/File-FileUtil-0.03


=head2 3.6.1 Installation support.

If there are installation problems or questions with the installation
contact

 603 882-0846 E<lt>support@SoftwareDiamonds.comE<gt>

=head2 3.6.2 Installation Tests.

Most Perl installation software will run the following test script(s)
as part of the installation:

 t/File/FileUtil/FileUtil.t

=head2 3.7 Possible problems and known errors

The I<pm2datah> and I<pm2data> methods determines the data section
by searching for the expression /^[\012\015]__DATA__/.
If somehow this sequence appears in the code,
it will cause a failure of these methods.
Thus, when using this function, statments such as the
below (if it is even a valid statement) cannot be used:

 $var = '
 __DATA__
 ';


The File::FileUtil program module is the foundation
program module for testing the 2167A automation modules
and must be rock solid to ensure the quality of
the Units that it will be testing.
Testing of this module should be proactive and
not dumped upon the end-user.

There is still much work needed to ensure the quality 
of this module as follows:

=over 4

=item *

State the functional requirements for each method 
including not only the GO paths but also what to
expect for the NOGO paths

=item *

All the tests are GO path tests. Should add
NOGO tests.

=item *

Add the requirements addressed as I<# R: >
comment to the tests

=item *

Write a program to build a matrix to trace
test step to the requirements and vice versa by
parsing the I<# R: > comments.
Automatically insert the matrix in the
Test::STDutil POD.

CHANGES:
THe following changes were made:

\=over 4

\=item test_lib2inc

Returns to parent directory of
the first t directory going up
from the test script instead of the
t directory.

\=item find_t_roots

Added the function find_t_roots that
returns the parent directory of all
the directories in @INC

\=back

Changes to past revisions are as follows: 

\=over 4

\=item Test::TestUtil 0.01

Originated

\=item Test::TestUtil 0.02

Correct failure from Josts Smokehouse" <Jost.Krieger+smokeback@ruhr-uni-bochum.de>
test run

t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil....Bareword "fspec_dirs" not allowed 
while "strict subs" in use at 

  /net/sunu991/disc1/.cpanplus/5.8.0/build/Test-TestUtil-0.01/blib/lib/Test/TestUtil.pm line 56.

Changed line 56 from

 my @dirs = (fspec_dirs) ? $from_package->splitdir( $fspec_dirs ) : ();

to

 my @dirs = ($fspec_dirs) ? $from_package->splitdir( $fspec_dirs ) : ();

This error is troublesome since the test passed on my system using Active Perl
under Microsoft NT. It should never have passed. 
This error is in a core method, I<fspec2fspec>,
that changes file specifications from one operating system
to another operating system.
This method has been in service unchanged for some time.

\=item Test::TestUtil 0.03

Correct failure from Josts Smokehouse" <Jost.Krieger+smokeback@ruhr-uni-bochum.de>
test run

PERL_DL_NONLAZY=1 /usr/local/perl/bin/perl "-MExtUtils::Command::MM" "-e" "test_harness(0, 'blib/lib', 'blib/arch')" t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t
t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil....# Test 18 got: '$VAR1 = '';
' (t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t at line 540 fail #17)
#    Expected: '$VAR1 = '\\=head1 Title Page

The I<pm2datah> method is not returning any data for Test 18. This will also cause
the test of I<pm2data>, test 19 to fail.
The I<pm2datah> is searching for the string "\n__DATA__\n".

The "\n" character on Perl is a logical end of line character sequence.
The "\n" end of line is different on Mr. Smokehouse's Unix operating system
than on my Windows NT operating system.
The test file was created under MSWin32 and uses a MSWin32 "\n".
Under UNIX, I<pm2datah> method will look for the Unix "\n"
and there will not be any.

Changed "\n__DATA__\n" to /[\012\015]__DATA__/. 

During the clean-up for CPAN, broke the I<format_hash_table>
method for tables in hash of hash format. 
Fixed the break, added test 29 to the I<t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t>
test script for this
feature, and added a discusssion of this feature in
POD discription for I<format_hash_table>

\=item Test::TestUtil 0.04

item our old friend visits again - DOS and UNIX text file incompatibility

This impacts other modules. We have to examine all modules for
this portability defect and correct any found defects.

Correct failure from Josts Smokehouse" <Jost.Krieger+smokeback@ruhr-uni-bochum.de>
and Kingpin <mthurn@carbon> test runs.

On Mr. Smokehouse's run email the got: VAR1 clearly showed extra white space
line that is not present in the expected: VAR1. 
In Mr. Kingpin's run the got: VAR1 and expected: VAR1 look visually the same.
However, the Unix found a difference(s) and failed the test.

For Mr. Smokehouse's run:

PERL_DL_NONLAZY=1 /usr/local/bin/perl "-MExtUtils::Command::MM" "-e" "test_harness(0, 'blib/lib', 'blib/arch')" t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t

What we have before, was a totally "failure to communicate." aka Cool Hand Luke. 
VAR1 was empty. Now VAR1 has something. It is not completely dead.
One probable cause is the Unix operating system must be producing two Unix \012 new lines 
for a Microsoft single newline \015\012.
Without being able to examine the test with a debugger, the only way to verify
this is to provide the fix and see if the problem goes away when this great group
of testers try for the fourth time. 

Revised I<fin> method to take a handle, change I<pm2datah> method handle,  I<$fh>, 
to binary by adding a I<binmode $fh> statement, and pass the actual
thru the I<fin> method for test 18.

Use I<fin($fh)> to read in the data for I<pm2data>, test 19 Unit Under Test (UUT),
instead of using the raw file handle.

The I<fin> method takes any \015\012 combination and changes it into the 
logical Perl new line, I<"\n">, for the current operating system.

A second thing that I would like you to reconsider is the naming of
"Test::TestUtil" respectively "Test::Tech" - neither of those is descriptive
of what the routines actually do or what the module implements. I would
recommend renaming them to something closer to your other modules, maybe
"Test::SVDMaker::Util" and "Test::SVDMaker::Tech", as some routines do not
seem to be specific to the Test::-suite but rather general
(format_array_table). Some parts (the "scrub" routines) might even better
live in another module namespace, "Test::Util::ScrubData" or something like
that.

Broke away all the file related methods from Test::TestUtil and
created this module File::FileUtil so the module name is
more descriptive of the methods within the module.

\=item *

Broke the smart nl code out of the fin method and made it
is own separate method, smart_nl method.

Perl, as Perl already does smart newline handling, (even though with the
advent of 5.8 even Unix-people have to learn the word "binmode" now :-)) 

The only place where I see Perl does smart newline handling is
the crlf IO displine introduce in Perl 5.6.  The File::FileUtil has
a use 5.001 so that 5.6 Perl built-ins cannot be used. Added comment
to smart_nl that for users with 5.6 Perl that it may be better to
use the built-in crlf IO discipline.

\=item *

For the load_package method that uses a eval "require $package" to load the
package, the $@ does not capture all the warnings and error messages,
at least not with ActiveState Perl.  Added code the captures also the
warnings, by temporaily reassigning  $SIG(__WARN__), and added these
to the $@ error messages.

\=item *

Added two new tests to verify the NOGO paths for the for the load_package
method.  One tests for load module failure looking for all the possilbe
information on why the module did not load. The other verifies that
the vocabulary is present after the loading the module.
This information is very helpful when you must remote debug a load
failure from CPAN testing whose is running on a different platform.

Added the method I<hex_dump>.

DOCUMENT_OVERVIEW:
This document releases ${NAME} version ${VERSION}
providing a description of the inventory, installation
instructions and other information necessary to
utilize and track this release.
^

CAPABILITIES:
The system is the Perl programming language software.
As established by the Perl referenced documents,
program modules, such the 
"L<File::FileUtil|File::FileUtil>" module, extend the Perl language.

This release adds low level utilites used initially in support of
the functional 
L<Test::STDmaker|Test::STDmaker> and
L<ExtUtils::SVDmaker|ExtUtils::SVDmaker>
For these functional modules, 
L<File::FileUtils|File::FileUtils> is a design module. 
However, the methods of L<File::FileUtils|File::FileUtils>
are of a general nature and may have uses in other modules.
Thus, in order to provide possible reuse in other modules,
the L<File::FileUtils|File::FileUtils> module is broken
out also as a functional module.

The dependency of the program modules in the US DOD STD2167A bundle is as follows:
 
 File::FileUtil 
   Test::STD::Scrub
     Test::Tech
        DataPort::FileType::FormDB DataPort::DataFile Test::STD::STDutil
            Test::STDmaker ExtUtils::SVDmaker

Test software should be short and not depend on any other
modules. In other words, it should use just the basic
core pure Perl and as little of the extension modules as possible.
As such these utilities are a collection of very short
methods, using core pure Perl and very few program modules
(SelfLoader and use File::Spec) 
of seemingly functionally unrelated methods.

Some of the capabilities they provide are as follows:

\=over 4

\=item *

Methods to change file specifications from
one operating system to another.

\=item *

Methods that address the issue of different
new line sequences for different operating systems

\=item *

Picking up data from program modules

\=item *

Loading program modules using an I<eval> and testing
that the program module vocabulary is present.

\=back

Note the 
L<File::FileUtil|File::FileUtil>, 
L<Test::STD::STDutil|Test::STD::STDutil> 
L<Test::STD::Scrub|Test::STD::Scrub> 
program modules breaks up 
the Test::TestUtil program module
and Test::TestUtil has disappeared.
^

PROBLEMS:
The I<pm2datah> and I<pm2data> methods determines the data section
by searching for the expression /^^[\012\015]__DATA__/.
If somehow this sequence appears in the code,
it will cause a failure of these methods.
Thus, when using this function, statments such as the
below (if it is even a valid statement) cannot be used:

 $var = '
 __DATA__
 ';


The File::FileUtil program module is the foundation
program module for testing the 2167A automation modules
and must be rock solid to ensure the quality of
the Units that it will be testing.
Testing of this module should be proactive and
not dumped upon the end-user.

There is still much work needed to ensure the quality 
of this module as follows:

\=over 4

\=item *

State the functional requirements for each method 
including not only the GO paths but also what to
expect for the NOGO paths

\=item *

All the tests are GO path tests. Should add
NOGO tests.

\=item *

Add the requirements addressed as I<# R: >
comment to the tests

\=item *

Write a program to build a matrix to trace
test step to the requirements and vice versa by
parsing the I<# R: > comments.
Automatically insert the matrix in the
Test::STDutil POD.
